Problem:
You are given the coordinates of four points in the 2D plane.
The first and the second pair of points form two different lines.
Print the longer line in format "(X1, Y1)(X2, Y2)" starting with the point that is closer to the center
of the coordinate system (0, 0) (You can reuse the method that you wrote for the previous problem).
If the lines are of equal length, print only the first one.
