SUPyF Objects and Classes - 07. Websites

Problem:
You have been tasked to create an ordered database of websites. For the task you will need to create a class Website,
which will have a Host, a Domain and Queries.
The Host and the Domain are simple strings.
The Queries, is Collections of strings.
You will be given several input lines in the following format:
{host} | {domain} | {query1,query2. . .}
Note: There will always be a host and a domain, but there might NOT be ANY queries.
The input sequence ends, when you receive the command “end”. Then you must print all websites in the following format:
https://www.{host}.{domain}/query?=[{query1]&[{query2}]&[query3]. . .
In case there are NO queries, just print:
https://www.{host}.{domain}

Examples:

INPUT:
    softuni | bg | user,course,homework
    judge.softuni | bg | contest,bg
    google | bg | search,query
    zamunda | net
    end
OUTPUT:
    https://www.softuni.bg/query?=[user]&[course]&[homework]
    https://www.judge.softuni.bg/query?=[contest]&[bg]
    https://www.google.bg/query?=[search]&[query]
